## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  The trick with the conditional expression of a loop is that it needs to evaluate to true to start the loop, and must at some point evaluate to false to stop the loop.
- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
  it runs once before the loop begins to iterate
  it typically is used to define the index variable
- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
  it runs before each iteration of the loop
  it defines the conditional expression which defines when the loop should stop iterating
- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  it runs after the code block of the loop for each iteration of the loop

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
  it is typically used to update the value of the index variable
- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
  designed primarily to loop through objects
